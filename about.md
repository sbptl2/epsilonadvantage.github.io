Hello! I'm Shyamal a second year PhD student studying CS Theory at Columbia and welcome to my blog! Starting a blog has a different motivators for me: For one thing writing tends to bring clarity for me, so I hope to explore and report back on various scientific claims here. Less practically though, I also hope that it motivates and encourages me to jump down more random fun rabbit holes and document some random thoughts I have. A few topics I have in mind are strategies for games, random problems and decisions that pop up in my life, and some experiments I want to try. Hope you enjoy :)
