# Increasing Mental Energy

Perhaps, one of my biggest problems, as far as productivity is concerned is my lack of mental energy. Sometimes, I am excited by even the smallest puzzle that life has to offer; my mind is sharp and attentive to details and ready to process. Other days, I go through the world on autopilot, not thinking about (and not excited about) the very same problems. Is this the way my mind is or a function of my diet, habit, exercise, etc? In this post, I want to describe various experiments that I will try to hopefully find out.

## What helps with mental energy?

We'll start with a google search and several popular health results [1,2,3]

Foods:
- Fatty Fish (Salmon, Tuna)
- Walnuts
- Dark Green Vegetables
- Kiwis and Citrus Fruits
- Whole Grains
- Eggs, Yogurt, Cheese
- Lean Proteins
- Orange, Red, and Green Veggies
- Pumpkin Seeds
- Berries
- Bananas
- Water

Vitamins, Minerals, and Chemicals:
- Caffeine
- B12
- Curcumin (Turmeric)
- Omega 3
- Ginseng
- Ginko Biloba

Activities:
- Meditation
- Cardio
- Mental Decompression
- Sleep
- Exercise
- Social Interaction
- Exposure to Sunlight
- Practice Focusing

Unfortunately, this feels like a few too many things to try all at once -- so let's try and narrow down the list a bit to find a smaller set of candidates. It really would be nice if these websites pointed to more concrete evidence for the efficacy of these methods.
