The other day one of my cousin's kids asked me to play Uno. Having not done research in some time, I had a little bit too much mental energy and noticed that they were sorting their cards by color and thought "That's an exploitable weakness, I wonder how much of an advantage that gives me?" So let's answer this along with a few other natural questions about how much better you can do than random in Uno. How effective is counting cards? How much does it help to know someones hand? What about just the colors? If you have a wild card, what color should you change to?

### Low Hanging Fruit
Perhaps one of the simplest things to compute is what to do when you only have two cards and are holding a wild card. Assuming you don't know anything about the hands of others and they are trying to 

### Baseline Strategy

As a baseline strategy, I will simply use the play a valid card if you can strategy and don't if you can't. In reality, people likely use more complicated heuristics. For instance, if they have two valid cards and one changes the color they will often prefer this card. If an opponent has uno and you know the color of their card, you have a preference to change the color or give them a draw two.
